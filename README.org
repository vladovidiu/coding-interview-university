* Plan
** I won't remember it all
[[https://startupnextdoor.com/retaining-computer-science-knowledge/][Retaining Computer Science Knowledge]]
** Flashcards
Create flashcards for everything worthy of remembering. Try [[http://ankisrs.net/][Anki]].
Use /space repetition/ to get better over time.
** Start doing coding interview questions while learning DS and algo
Once I learned a topic, open one of the interview books and do a few questions (or any equivalent website like LeetCoder).
** Review, review, review
Repo comes with cheatsheets. Make a habit of going over them at various times.
Take a break from questions and go through the flashcards.
** Focus
As per =Deep Work= book, use the most productive time to learn.

* Prerequisite Knowledge
Learning =C= would be amazing. Here's a good, short book - [[https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628][The C Programming Language, Vol 2]]
